#MM1521A busboard project

This busboard is based on the Moraydular wide powerbus available at https://github.com/vaeinoe/moraydular/tree/master/powerbus

The main changes were aimed at optimising the board for a synth-building workshop where it would be used in a 104HP-wide case. Therefore the MTA 0.1" connectors and the quickconnect spade connectors have been stripped out, and we have just left well-labelled inlet pads and as many connectors as possible to handle a 104HP row while staying within the 300-pin free limit for DipTrace.

The board has been further tweaked to optimise it for novice builders at a synth building workshop, by paying attention to thermal isolation.
