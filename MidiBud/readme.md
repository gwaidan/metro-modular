# MidiBud

This is forked from the MidiBud v0.3 files published at https://midisizer.com/about/midibud/

The original is a nifty repurposing of the Mutable MidiPal for desktop experimentation.


<b>v0.51j (initial release):</b> Changes from the original include:

-fixed a missing trace in the original;

-ported to KiCad 8 from the deprecated EAGLE format;

-retention peg holes added to allow use of Omron/Alps keyswitches as well as the standard E-Switch TL1100;

-encoder footprint with slotted retention tab pads to accommpdate the Bourns PEC11R series;

-moved a redundant input blocking diode to give reverse voltage protection to the 7805;

-SMD1206 bypass caps on the ATMega.
