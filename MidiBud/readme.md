# MidiBud (forked from Pete@kvitek.com)

This is based on the MidiBud v0.3 published at https://midisizer.com/about/midibud/

The original is a nifty repurposing of the Mutable MidiPal for desktop experimentation.

To keep it compatible with current free software, it has been ported from EAGLE into KiCad 8, and the design has been tweaked by addin holes for retention pegs to make it compatible with Omron keyswitches, small optimisations to the power supply circuitry, and SMD1206 bypass caps on the micro.
