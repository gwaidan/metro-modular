# MidiBud

This is forked from the MidiBud v0.3 published at https://midisizer.com/about/midibud/

The original is a nifty repurposing of the Mutable MidiPal for desktop experimentation.

v0.51j (first public release): To keep it compatible with current free software, it has been ported from EAGLE into KiCad 8, and the design has been tweaked by adding holes for retention pegs to make it compatible with Omron keyswitches, an encoder footprint that handles wider retention tabs, small optimisations to the power supply circuitry, and SMD1206 bypass caps on the micro.
